 
Description:
 This utility can be used to detect button press events of the FoxG20
 Board on-board push button and execute an arbitrary shell command.
 Short and long button press events are distinguished, so 2 different 
 shell commands can be specified to be run at the related event.

Files:
  foxbtn-exec.c
  Source file, build on the FoxG20 with "gcc -o foxbtn-exec foxbtn-exec.c"

  foxg20_btn_exec
  Init script to start up the button detection automatically as a service 
  on the FoxG20. As default behaviour, a short button press (<3s) will 
  result in a reboot, a long button press in system shutdown.

Installation:
